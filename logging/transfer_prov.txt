Step 1: Load Recipe and Save its Metadata to >>> workflow-analysis/team3_metadata.csv 

Step 2: Summarize Mass-edits >>> Apply Net Effect to Merge Edits 
Save Merged Recipe to >>> prepared_recipe/team3_prepared.json 
Merge step 1: output of previous edits overlap with input of current edits 
Example: {from: a, to:b}, {from:b, to:c} >>> {from:a, to:b}, {from: [a,b], to:c}

Step 3: Compare number of edits From Original Recipe and Merged Recipe: 
Before merging,the total number of edits is 29528 
After merging, the number of edits is 29527 
Step 4: Enable Provenance with Mass-edits >>> 
 Start OpenRefine with Project id >>> 2548411792946 
Save Recipe Embeded with Provenance to >>> prov_save_recipe/team3_prov.json
