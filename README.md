Data cleaning provenance generalization

1. Generalize edit functions with two functions: 1. group by target values; 2. transitive rules to discard internal data values
2. resolve scalability issues and improve reusability of edit functions in data cleaning

Naive Provenance VS Generalized Provenance 

Because of generalization, provenance loss might occur on cell-level.

3. Provenance-store: model naive provenance; processing data; and generalized provenance.

Ensure the consistent query-answering after the generalization
